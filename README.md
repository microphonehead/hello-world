# hello-world

I have experience in programming in other languages like Basic and Pascal. I like to code in my spare time as a hobby, and i'm interested in making 2d games.

I bought a Raspberry Pi and discovered Python, which soon became my language of choice to develop in. I'm really interested in Python because it is object orientated, runs on my Raspberry Pi, and comes with a large number of modules that are free to use and easily imported into my projects.  I use Pygame to make 2d games.
